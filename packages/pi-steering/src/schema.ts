 * import the explicit Outer / Inner flavor.

 * `Pattern | Pattern[] | { pattern, onUnknown? }` (leaf-level
 * `onUnknown:` honored at the outer when-level via `evaluateCwd` /

	 * stream BEFORE the `ts_max` comparison runs. Typical use:
	 * `happened: { event, in: "agent_loop", notIn: "tool_call" }` -

 * Type-erased alias for {@link PredicateHandler} used at registry

 *
 * TypeScript treats function-argument types as contravariant: a
 * `PredicateHandler<CommitsAheadArgs>` is **not** assignable to a
 * `PredicateHandler<unknown>` because the handler needs to *accept*
 * `unknown`, while the specialized handler only accepts a narrower
 * shape. Using `any` at the registry slot leverages TS's bivariance
 * fallback — specifically-typed handlers assign without a cast, and
 * the engine's generic call site stays safe because it passes the
 * matching `when.<name>` value straight through to the handler
 * (the handler already validates its own arg shape).
 *
 * Prefer this alias at any `Record<string, PredicateHandler<…>>`
 * boundary where the value shape is per-key heterogeneous.
 *
 * ## Write-through registry slot, not a safe read type
 *
 * This alias exists so heterogeneous handler maps accept typed
 * handlers cast-free on the WRITE side (plugin author stuffs a
 * `PredicateHandler<FooArgs>` into `Plugin.predicates`). On the READ
 * side (a consumer iterating `plugin.predicates`, or a decorator /
 * middleware layering over a plugin's handlers) the retrieved value
 * carries `args: any` — no compile-time narrowing. Consumers that
 * want typed reads should narrow back to `PredicateHandler<TArgs>`
 * at their call site.
 *
 * ## Handler authors: declare `PredicateHandler<YourArgs>`, not this
 *
 * Do NOT use `AnyPredicateHandler` as the type annotation for a
 * handler declaration:
 *
 *   // wrong — `args` is `any`, no narrowing inside the body.
 *   const myHandler: AnyPredicateHandler = (args, ctx) => { ... };
 *
 *   // right — narrow `args` at the declaration; the result still
 *   // assigns cast-free into `Plugin.predicates`.
 *   const myHandler: PredicateHandler<MyArgs> = (args, ctx) => { ... };
 *
 * Also note: because `any` at the boundary disables compile-time
 * narrowing on the engine's CALL site too, typed handlers MUST
 * still validate their own `args` shape at the top of the function
 * body. The engine passes the verbatim `when.<name>` value, so TS
 * can't protect you from a user writing
 * `when: { myPredicate: "not-the-shape-you-expected" }`.
 * (See `isClean`'s `if (typeof args !== "boolean") return false`
 * pattern for the canonical guard.)

	 * reasons get the prefix-on-its-own-line layout automatically

/**
 * Structured issue surfaced while loading a steering config.
 *
 * Diagnostics flow up from the loader and the plugin merger into the
 * bridge runtime, which decides whether to throw or log per the user's
 * strict-mode preference. The shape is stable so tests and future
 * tooling can dispatch on {@link kind} without scanning {@link message}
 * substrings.
 *
 * Channel-ownership split (loader / merger vs. runtime). Diagnostics
 * captured in this stream are by-design surfaced to the strict-mode
 * runtime so it can decide whether to throw or pass through to
 * `console.warn`. The loader (`loader.ts`) does not call
 * `console.*` directly — the runtime owns the policy decision.
 * However, by-design info breadcrumbs that are NOT configuration
 * issues (`disabledPlugins` and `disabledRules` opt-outs from
 * `resolvePlugins`, dropped-observer notices from
 * `dropUnusedObservers`) go directly to `console.info` from where
 * they're produced. They're not in this kind union because they
 * describe normal behavior the user opted into, not problems that
 * need actioning.
 *
 * Render-format matrix — the same diagnostic surfaces in two
 * shapes depending on which renderer the runtime picks:
 *
 *   - Multi-line aggregate (thrown `Error` from `buildSessionRuntime`):
 *     a header line ("N config issues:") followed by a per-line bullet
 *     `  - [type] <path: >?<message>`. One `Error.message`, multi-line.
 *     Used when at least one diagnostic must abort the session.
 *     Produced by `formatAggregatedDiagnostics`.
 *   - Single-line per-diagnostic (`formatSingleLineDiagnostic`):
 *     `[pi-steering] <ERROR: >?<path: >?<message>` per diagnostic.
 *     Routed to `console.warn` for legacy fail-soft mode
 *     (`failOnWarnings: false`). Only warnings reach this route in
 *     practice — error-class diagnostics escalate to a thrown error
 *     via the aggregated form before warnings are flushed. Also
 *     routed to stderr for the CLI `pi-steering list` pre-flight
 *     surface (both warnings and errors render here, with `ERROR: `
 *     distinguishing the latter). The function itself accepts both
 *     severities; the warnings-only narrowing is a property of the
 *     `console.warn` route's caller, not the formatter.
 *
 * The CLI prints diagnostics inline as the loader yields them, rather
 * than aggregating into a thrown error — the single-line shape
 * gives `pi-steering list` users immediate per-issue feedback.

	 *     These diagnostics name the participants (layer paths or
	 *     plugin names) inside `message` because there is no single
	 *     source path — the collision spans multiple layers or
	 *     plugins.
