 * Git plugin for `@cad0p/pi-steering`.
 *
 * Subpath import: `pi-steering/plugins/git`.
 *
 * Registers (in the terms of `Plugin`):
 *
 *   - `predicates`         - `branch`, `upstream`, `commitsAhead`,
 *                             `hasStagedChanges`, `isClean`, `remote`.
 *                             See the per-item files under
 *                             `./predicates/` for the arg shapes each
 *                             handler accepts.
 *   - `rules`              - `no-main-commit-github` (github-flavored,
 *                             first-match-wins) + `no-main-commit`
 *                             (generic fallback). Both non-overridable
 *                             (issue #79): no inline override escape
 *                             hatch; users disable via
 *                             `disabledRules: ["no-main-commit"]` /
 *                             `["no-main-commit-github"]` or opt out
 *                             of the whole plugin with
 *                             `disabledPlugins: ["git"]`.
 *                             Plus the destructive-command rails
 *                             migrated from the engine's former
 *                             `DEFAULT_RULES` (issue #72):
 *                             `no-force-push` (sealed, issue #65 —
 *                             every remote-history-rewrite form) and
 *                             `no-hard-reset`. Both override-comment
 *                             eligible.
 *   - `trackers.branch`    - sequential `git checkout` / `git switch`
 *                             branch tracker. See `./trackers/branch-tracker.ts`.
 *   - `trackerExtensions.cwd.git`
 *                            - per-command `--git-dir=` / `--work-tree=`
 *                              parser layered on the core cwd tracker.
 *                              See `./trackers/cwd-extensions.ts`.
 *
 * Also re-exported as composable building blocks for downstream
 * plugins (e.g. RDS-style multi-package `cr --all` scans that need
 * to query git state per subpackage directory):
 *
 *   - `getBranch(ctx, cwd?)`            — current branch or `null`
 *   - `getUpstream(ctx, cwd?)`          — upstream name or `null`
 *   - `getCommitsAhead(ctx, wrt?, cwd?)` — commit count or `null`
 *   - `getStagedChanges(ctx, cwd?)`     — boolean or `null`
 *   - `getWorkingTreeClean(ctx, cwd?)`  — boolean or `null`
 *   - `getRemoteUrl(ctx, cwd?)`         — origin URL or `null`
 *   - `walkerString(value)`             — walker-sentinel narrowing
 *                                          helper for plugin-author
 *                                          predicates
 *   - `NO_CHECKOUT_IN_CHAIN`            — branch-tracker fall-through
 *                                          sentinel
 *   - `GIT_COMMIT_PATTERN`              — shared `git commit` regex
 *                                          source used by both
 *                                          commit-on-main rules
 *   - `PROTECTED_BRANCH_PATTERN`         — shared protected-branch
 *                                          regex (main / master /
 *                                          mainline / trunk) used by
 *                                          both commit-on-main rules
 *
 * See `./helpers/git-ops.ts` for the helper contract (all collapse
 * failure modes to `null`; caller decides what to do with it).
 *
 * Opt-in: there are NO engine-injected default plugins or rules
 * (issue #72), so this plugin is registered ONLY when the user
 * declares it:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import gitPlugin from "@cad0p/pi-steering/plugins/git";
 * export default defineConfig({ plugins: [gitPlugin] });
 * ```
 *
 * Declaring it explicitly also feeds its rule / predicate names into
 * `defineConfig`'s type unions (typo-checking on `disabledRules` /
 * `disabledPlugins`); an undeclared plugin's names are NOT in the
 * inferred union, so typos surface as compile errors instead of
 * silent no-ops.
 *
 * Tests construct configs explicitly and pass the plugin in the
 * `plugins` array.
 *
 * ## Note for plugin authors
 *
 * This is the canonical reference plugin. Third-party plugins are
 * expected to mirror this layout - one file per concern (tracker /
 * extension / predicates / rules), a terse default export assembling
 * them. Copy-adapt liberally.

 * paths, scratch repos with non-github remotes) the github rule's
 * `remote:` predicate doesn't match → the engine falls through to
 * the generic `no-main-commit`. Reordering for stylistic reasons
 * breaks this routing; pinned via a unit test in `./index.test.ts`.
 *
 * The two commit-on-main rules route between themselves only — the
 * pattern-based rails (`no-force-push`, `no-hard-reset`, migrated
 * from the engine's former `DEFAULT_RULES` in issue #72) target
 * disjoint command shapes, so their position relative to the pair
