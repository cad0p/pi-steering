 * helper, and the engine cannot import from a plugin without inverting
 * the dependency graph.

 * `evaluateCwd` keeps its inline fast-path optimization for the
 * single-pattern shorthand; the gitPlugin's `unwrapPatternArg`
 * normalizes once and shares the result across `branch` / `upstream`
 * / `remote`); only the type predicate is shared.

 * Without the `v is Pattern` type predicate, the same expression
