/**
 * Example: combined-git-discipline rule pack.
 *
 * Equivalent to `steering.json` in this directory but expressed in the
 * canonical TypeScript form. Drop this file in at
 * `.pi/steering.ts` (or `.pi/steering/index.ts`) to activate.
 *
 * Stacks two guardrails on top of the declared domain plugins:
 *
 *   1. `no-amend` - no `git commit --amend` (rewrites history).
 *   2. `pr-create-must-be-draft` - `gh pr create` must include
 *       `--draft`.
 *
 * Since issue #72 nothing is engine-injected: this config DECLARES
 * git + rm to get the classic rails (plus minimal synthetic `gh`
 * facts — the real `gh` table is owned by pi-steering-github#61).
 * Force pushes need NO extra rule here: since issue #65 the git
 * plugin's `no-force-push` rule is sealed — it already blocks every
 * remote-history-rewrite form (`--force`, `--force-with-lease`,
 * bundled shorts like `-uf`, leading-`+` refspecs, `--mirror`). Older
 * copies of this pack disabled that rule and re-added a stricter
 * variant; that disable-and-replace step is redundant (and would
 * actually WEAKEN coverage — see ../force-push-strict for the idiom if
 * you genuinely want to swap the shipped rule out).
 *
 * Use this as a starting point for teams that want "disciplined PR
 * flow" out of the box. Tweak individual routing + leaves downstream.
 *
 * Scope note: the other shipped rails (no-hard-reset via git,
 * no-rm-rf-slash via rm) are active because their plugins are
 * declared explicitly below.
