/**
 * Example: draft-prs-only rule pack.
 *
 * Equivalent to `steering.json` in this directory but expressed in the
 * v0.1.0 canonical TypeScript form. Drop this file in at
 * `.pi/steering.ts` (or `.pi/steering/index.ts`) to activate.
 *
 * What it enforces: `gh pr create` must include `--draft`. Useful on
 * teams that require a human review step before flipping a PR from
 * draft to ready.
 *
 * Scope note: the rule is additive. Since issue #72 nothing is
 * engine-injected — the rm declaration below restores the classic
 * filesystem rail; drop it if you want THIS PACK ONLY. The git plugin
 * isn't declared here, so its rules stay inert.
 *
 * gh facts: the real `gh` CLI table is owned by pi-steering-github#61
 * (not landed). Until then this pack declares a minimal synthetic
 * `gh` table (`draft`, plus `repo` so `gh -R <repo> pr create` keeps
 * its subcommand routed) — both entries are real `gh` flags. Swap in
 * the owning plugin when it lands.
