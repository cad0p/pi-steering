/**
 * Context-provided command facade (issue #101; #110 entry-only rebind).
 *
 * A `SteeringCommand` is a bound view over one already-parsed
 * {@link PredicateToolInput}: the engine builds it per command ref from
 * `input.args` + `input.envAssignments` (see `commandFromInput`), so
 * rule code never threads bare `Word[]` arrays by hand. `mockContext`
 * builds the same view, so unit-tested predicates see it too.
 *
 * Each flag method delegates to the mechanism in `./flags.ts` with identical
 * precedence/edge semantics (`matchFlagAt` exact → attached → glued;
 * quote-aware `.value`-first reads). `positionals()` adds the bound
 * positional view over the same snapshot with the same bound consuming
 * set — consumption and skipping cannot diverge.
 *
 * Bound invariant: passed entries select SPELLINGS only; consumption/glue
 * ALWAYS come from the bound `ResolvedArity`, never from a passed entry's
 * `takesValue` (via the module-private `boundEntryViews` adapter).
 *
 * Deliberate non-goals:
 *
 *   - No exported string→words lexer. The walker already parsed the
 *     command into `ctx.input.args` (quote-aware); a second lexing
 *     implementation would be drift by construction. String holders
 *     migrate at the rule level by reading `ctx.command`.
 *   - No `resolve: "first"` option. First-wins models no real parser
 *     (ADR 2026-08-21); only last-wins (`getFlagValue`) + all-values
 *     (`getAllFlagValues`) exist.
 *   - Join policy lives in consumers, never core — e.g. git
 *     concatenates repeated `-m` with `"\n\n"` at the rule level.
