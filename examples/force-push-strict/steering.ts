/**
 * Example: force-push-strict rule pack.
 *
 * Equivalent to `steering.json` in this directory but expressed in the
 * canonical TypeScript form. Drop this file in at
 * `.pi/steering.ts` (or `.pi/steering/index.ts`) to activate.
 *
 * NOTE (issue #65): the git plugin's `no-force-push` rule is SEALED —
 * it blocks every remote-history-rewrite form (`--force`,
 * `--force-with-lease`, `--force-if-includes`, bundled shorts like
 * `-uf`, leading-`+` refspecs like `git push origin +main`, and
 * `--mirror`) with a dedicated reason message. That makes this pack
 * REDUNDANT for its original purpose: the plugin's rule covers
 * everything here, and more. The pack is kept as a REFERENCE for the
 * disable-and-replace idiom — dropping a shipped rule via
 * `disabledRules` and installing your own rule under a new name —
 * which is the mechanism you'd use to customize (or loosen) any
 * shipped rule. Its routing + leaves mirror the sealed rule.
 *
 * Shape:
 *
 *   - `plugins: [gitPlugin, forcePushSignalPlugin]` declares the
 *     shipping plugin (since issue #72 nothing is engine-injected, so
 *     the rules only exist if the plugin is declared — and its names
 *     only typo-check if it is; the declaration also supplies the git
 *     CLI facts the replacement rule's `subcommand:` leaf resolves
 *     against) plus the inline single-predicate plugin that registers
 *     the replacement rule's named force signal below.
 *   - `disabledRules: ["no-force-push"]` drops the plugin's rule so
 *     ours owns the block message (otherwise its message would win
 *     on `git push --force`).
 *   - `no-force-push-strict` fires on `--force` (any position),
 *     `--force-with-lease`, `--force-if-includes`, bundled short
 *     flags (`-f`, `-uf`, `-fu`, `-nfv`), leading-`+` refspecs
 *     (`git push origin +main`), and `--mirror`. The `subcommand:
 *     "push"` leaf keeps the pre-subcommand flag coverage of the
 *     sealed rule (`git -C /path push --force`,
 *     `git -c key=val push --force`, `git --git-dir=/x push -f`).
 *
 * Scope note: the git plugin's `no-main-commit` also fires once the
 * plugin is declared. If that's not wanted, add
 * `disabledRules: ["no-force-push", "no-main-commit"]`.
