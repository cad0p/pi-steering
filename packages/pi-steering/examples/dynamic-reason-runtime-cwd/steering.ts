/**
 * Example: dynamic-reason + walker-unknown-cwd pattern.
 *
 * Demonstrates how external plugin authors compose runtime-cwd
 * predicates (gitPlugin's `isClean` / `hasStagedChanges` / `remote` /
 * `upstream` / `commitsAhead` — each inlines a walker-unknown-cwd
 * guard at the top of its handler and surfaces trinary `"unknown"`)
 * with informative agent-facing reasons that distinguish two
 * branches:
 *
 *   - Static cwd + predicate fires: domain-specific reason text
 *     (the working tree is genuinely dirty).
 *   - Walker-unknown cwd: `walkerUnknownCwdReason()` explains the
 *     walker couldn't statically resolve cwd, surfaces the actual
 *     `ctx.cwd`, and prompts a retry with a literal path. The
 *     example appends a small piece of domain-specific retry
 *     guidance after the helper's output.
 *
 * Drop this file in at `.pi/steering.ts` (or
 * `.pi/steering/index.ts`) to activate. The example uses gitPlugin's
 * `isClean` predicate to gate `npm run deploy` on a clean working
 * tree.
