/**
 * `no-main-commit-github` — block direct commits to a protected
 * branch (main / master / mainline / trunk) on github.com clones.
 * Specialization of {@link noMainCommit} that emits PR-flow guidance
 * instead of the generic feature-branch reminder.
 *
 * Pairs with {@link noMainCommit}: this rule is more specific (adds
 * `remote:` check), placed BEFORE `noMainCommit` in the plugin's
 * rule array so first-match-wins routing surfaces the github-
 * flavored reason on github clones. Non-github contexts (Brazil
 * packages, vault paths, /tmp scratch repos with non-github remotes)
 * fall through to the generic `noMainCommit`.
 *
 * Override: allowed (intentionally overridable for legitimate cases
 * like release-process commits to main). User can:
 *   - Disable: `disabledRules: ["no-main-commit-github"]`
 *   - Per-invocation: `# steering-override: no-main-commit-github` comment
 *   - Customize: see gitPlugin's README "Customization" section
 *
 * @remarks Both `https://github.com/...` and `git@github.com:...`
 *          clone URLs are matched (the `remote:` regex's `[/:]`
 *          character class accepts both the HTTPS path separator
 *          and the SSH user-host separator).
 *
 * @remarks `remote:` is configured as `{ pattern, onUnknown: "allow" }`.
 *          The `onUnknown: "allow"` argument governs the case where
 *          the walker resolved cwd but the inner exec couldn't
 *          determine the remote URL — i.e. a known-cwd repo with no
 *          `origin` remote configured (fresh-init, repo with
 *          `upstream` but no `origin`, or other exec failure). In that
 *          case the predicate skips and the engine falls through to
 *          the generic `noMainCommit` (correct generic message).
 *          The branch predicate stays at default `onUnknown: "block"`
 *          (fail-closed) so protected-branch detection isn't weakened.
 *
 * Walker-unknown cwd: the `remote:` leaf surfaces trinary
 * `"unknown"` (via the inline walker-unknown-cwd guard at the top of
 * the handler) before the inner exec runs whenever
 * `walkerState.cwd === "unknown"`. The engine's leaf-level
 * `onUnknown:` policy reads the `"allow"` set on the leaf, projects
 * `"unknown" → false`, and the github rule SKIPS. The engine then
 * falls through to the generic {@link noMainCommit} (only `branch:`
 * leaf), which fires fail-CLOSED and emits the generic
 * protected-branch reason. The github-specific rule deliberately
 * does NOT fire under walker-unknown cwd — a github-flavored reason
 * would overstate what the engine has confirmed.
 *
 * Walker-unknown branch state: when `walkerState.cwd` is known but
 * the branch tracker collapses to its `"unknown"` sentinel (dynamic
 * checkout the walker couldn't resolve), the reason fn routes to a
 * "could not verify the current branch" message rather than
 * asserting a specific protected branch the engine hasn't
 * confirmed.
 *
 * Pattern is shared with `noMainCommit` via the exported
 * {@link GIT_COMMIT_PATTERN} constant so the two rules' bash-
 * command applicability stays byte-equal as the family evolves.
 *
 * @see {@link noMainCommit}
