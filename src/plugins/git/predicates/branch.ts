/**
 * Resolved outcome of reading a string tracker value from
 * `ctx.walkerState[key]`. Callers MUST distinguish the three cases:
 *
 *   - `value`   - the tracker resolved the value statically for this
 *                  command ref. Use it directly.
 *   - `unknown` - the tracker observed a write it couldn't resolve
 *                  statically (e.g. `git checkout $VAR`). The walker
 *                  deliberately surfaces this to signal "a change
 *                  occurred but I can't name the new value". Falling
 *                  through to `exec` would return the PRE-write
 *                  value and silently defeat the walker's static
 *                  tracking - exactly the case it exists for.
 *                  Callers must apply their `onUnknown` policy.
 *   - `missing` - no tracker modifier fired for this dimension in
 *                  this ref's scope (the walker threaded the
 *                  tracker's initial sentinel, or `walkerState` has
 *                  no key for this tracker at all). `exec` fallback
 *                  is correct here: the shell's current state is the
 *                  value the predicate wants.
 *
 * The three-way split requires cooperation from the tracker: its
 * `initial` value must be distinct from its `unknown` sentinel, so
 * the predicate can tell "no modifier fired" apart from "modifier
 * fired and couldn't resolve". `branchTracker` does this via
 * {@link NO_CHECKOUT_IN_CHAIN}. A tracker that reuses `"unknown"`
 * for both initial and unknown would collapse these two cases -
 * preserved here as `missing` for backward compatibility (the
 * predicate then behaves as it did pre-U1, shelling out on any
 * unknown).

 *       current bash chain contains `git checkout` / `git switch`.
 *       Three outcomes:
 *         - value resolved statically (e.g. `git checkout main`) ->
 *           match the pattern against it.
 *         - `"unknown"` sentinel (dynamic checkout like `git checkout

 *           return the PRE-checkout branch (the walker exists to
 *           track exactly this kind of in-chain change statically).
 *         - missing (no checkout in chain) -> fall through to exec.
 *   2. `git branch --show-current` in `ctx.cwd`. Empty stdout is
 *       treated as "no branch" (detached HEAD) - the predicate falls
 *       back to `onUnknown`.
 *
