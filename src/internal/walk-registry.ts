/**
 * Single source of truth for the walker's effective tracker registry.
 *
 * The rule surface ({@link buildEvaluator} → `prepareBashState`) and the
 * observer watch surface ({@link extractRefTextsForBash} → the
 * observer-dispatcher's dispatch path) must resolve the SAME bash
 * command to the SAME strings — issue #51/#52 pinned that contract, and
 * issue #54 closed the last divergence: the watch side used to re-walk
 * with the built-in `envTracker` only, so a plugin registering
 * `trackers: { env }` or `trackerExtensions.env` (both legal — `env` is
 * not a reserved tracker name) changed what RULES saw without changing
 * what OBSERVERS matched.
 *
 * Both consumers call {@link buildWalkRegistry} on the `resolved`
 * plugin state they already receive and derive their own registry:
 *
 *   - {@link buildEvaluator} (rule surface),
 *   - {@link buildObserverDispatcher} (watch surface) — seeding the
 *     watch walk with the same registry + the per-event `ctx.cwd`.
 *
 * Walkers are pure over the registry (each `walk` seeds per-walk state
 * from `tracker.initial` and never mutates the trackers), so two
 * registries built from the same `resolved` cannot diverge — the
 * module is the single source of truth, not object identity.
 *
 * ## Fallback contract
 *
 * The registry MUST always contain `env` and `cwd` so the built-in
 * `when.cwd` predicate + cd's env-aware resolution work even when no
 * plugin ships them — this is the correctness core of the module: a
 * consumer that spread `resolved.composedTrackers` directly would walk
 * with NO env tracker when none is registered and resolve every
 * `$VAR` raw (worse than the pre-issue-54 builtin-only watch side).
 * When no plugin registers a tracker by name, the built-in
 * `cwdTracker` / `envTracker` are used AND any
 * `resolved.trackerModifiers["cwd"]` / `["env"]` extensions are layered
 * on top (the plugin merger preserves extensions targeting these names
 * via `knownBuiltinTrackers`).
 *
 * Env goes in first so cd's modifier sees the current ref's env via
 * the `allState` read; walker iteration is registration-order stable
 * (Object.keys on an object literal) — the ordering is a soft
 * guarantee good for the built-in composition, not a hard API contract.
 *
 * ## Caller obligations
 *
 * Callers MUST NOT mutate the returned trackers (or the trackers they
 * contain). Walk is read-only over the registry; mutation would leak
 * across the two surfaces and re-introduce divergence. Containers are
 * freshly spread per call, but the individual trackers (and their
 * `modifiers` maps) are shared references with `resolved.composedTrackers`
 * — treat the whole result as read-only.
 *
 * ## Fail-open note
 *
 * The watch surface keeps its `null`-fallback: a command that fails to
 * parse falls back to RAW-only matching (see
 * {@link extractRefTextsForBash}). In the `not: { missing }` latch
 * idiom that fallback is fail-open (a parse crash silently never
 * records → the latch guard goes inert); empirically unreachable today
 * (the parser survived env-refs, arithmetic, `[[ ]]`,
 * process-substitution, case, nested quotes in the issue-54 probe),
 * but callers should know the raw-only tail exists.
